# ZTalk Rebuild Project

## app Purpose
- Real-time group and private messaging on local networks
- Multiple SSH connection handling 
- Automate SSH workflows (e.g., bulk server updates, script deployment) across multiple connections.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab) for local network-triggered builds.
- Built-in tools for latency testing, bandwidth analysis, and device discovery.
- Real-time alerts for SSH connection failures or network bottlenecks.
- Encrypted file sharing (SFTP/SCP) directly via SSH channels.
- Drag-and-drop bulk transfers between local devices.
- Bridge local servers with cloud instances (AWS, Azure) via SSH tunneling.
- Zero-configuration networking
- Support for both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections
- etc
- Embed task boards (Kanban-style) within group chats for agile workflows.
- Assign roles/permissions (e.g., admin, editor, guest) for secure collaboration.
- Generate logs of SSH activity, file transfers, and chat history for audits.
